Experiment:
1) Write shell scripts to print system information. 
2) Write shell script to perform basic mathematical calculation. 
3) Use redirection operators to store the output of commands.

Terminal commands and screenshots:
1) Shell Script for system information:
   Shell scripts are used to automate commands and processes in a Unix/Linux environment. A script can be written to retrieve various system details such as the kernel version,
   CPU architecture, memory usage, disk space, and system uptimeCommon commands like uname -a, df -h, free -m, and uptime are used to gather system information.
   The shell script provides a quick way to retrieve and display important system details with a single command, saving time and effort for system administrators.

2) Basic mathematical calculation:
   Shell scripting can also be used to perform mathematical calculations. The script can take input values and use built-in operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3)Redirection operation 
Redirection in shell scripts is used to control where the output of a command goes. By default, the output is displayed on the terminal, but redirection allows for it to be sent to a file or another command.
The > operator is used to redirect output to a file, while >> appends the output to an existing file. For example, command > output.txt will store the result of the command in the file output.txt.
This is useful for logging, saving output for later analysis, or passing information to other processes.
