Experiment: Implement chown, chmod command with their options 

Theory:
chown Command: Used to change the ownership of files or directories. It allows modification of both user and group ownership.

OWNER: Specifies the new file owner.
GROUP: Specifies the new file group.
FILE: The file or directory whose ownership is being changed.

chmod Command: Used to change file permissions (read, write, execute) of files or directories.

2. File Permissions and Ownership:
File Ownership:

User Ownership: The owner can read, write, and execute.
Group Ownership: Group members can have specific permissions.
Others: Users not owning the file or in the group.

File Permissions:

Read (r): Allows viewing the fileâ€™s content.
Write (w): Allows modifying the file.
Execute (x): Allows executing the file as a program.

Objectives:
chown: Modify file ownership to ensure proper user/group access.
chmod: Change file permissions to control access for users/groups.
